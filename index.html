  <p>Hello there! My name is Manaswini. I am an undergraduate at University at Buffalo studying computer science. My passions include coding, dancing and coffee. I would love to code while dancing and sip coffee in between. I am trying to improve my coding skills everyday by trying to learn one new thing every single day in the world of coding. As a result of that this website was built:)</p>
